# Personal Resume Website

### ReactJS + TailwindCSS + ThreeJS + Firebase
ReactJS was used for the front-end development, TailwindCSS was the framework used for the styling, ThreeJS was used for the 3D animation and Firebase for the deployment.

I wanted to make a personal website that showcased my resume in a unique way. I followed this tutorial: [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/0fYi8SGA20k/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fYi8SGA20k)

The tutorial assisted me in getting all the envrionments ready for the website. For examples, setting up TailwindCSS, ThreeJS and getting a React template to hit the ground running. It is not an exact 1-to-1 replica of the tutorial as I have made some changes that made sense to me:

### Changes Made
Several chnages were made from the original tutorial like:

ðŸ’¡ The first major change was to remove the Testimonials section. The original tutorial had a section dedicated to testimonials. However, this is not something that I needed as I am not a freelancer to have customers and for them to leave any feedback.
  
ðŸ’¡ Another change that was made was to add in the Education section. Originally, there was no section to highlight educational qualification therefore, I decided to add it in. I already had a templated for how the Experience section was done and I just decided to replicate that.

ðŸ’¡ The Projects section was also changed slightly. Rather than just having a clickable icon to GitHub repo, I changed it so that the clickable icon will represent the technology being used. Meaning, if the icon is Python, it will link to a GitHub code repository, and if its is a Tableau dashboard, it will go to my Tableau public profile. Some code adjustments were made to have this happen.

ðŸ’¡ I modified the Contact section and now I won't be recieving any emails to contact me. The email service is something additional and for me it is unnecessary. As a result, I just made a thank you note and links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, Email, Tableau Public and NovyPro profiles.

ðŸ’¡ The Technology section was also modified. A title was given and I changed it to technologies that I am familiar with.

ðŸ’¡ I deployed the website on Firebase. The tutorial walked through how to deploy on Hostinger however, it was a paid tier whereas Fireabse is free. With Firebase I was able to set-up GitHub actions and so any changes that I make will be reflected in the website.

### Limitations
- The website works very well on desktop browsers which include, Chrome, Firefox and Edge to name a few.
- The website has limitations in rendering webGL elements on mobile version of Google Chrome, the mobile version is capped at rendering 10-webGL elements.
- Mobile versions of Firefox and Safari work as they have a much higher limit in terms of how many elements are rendered.
